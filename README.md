## Introduction

Tools for working with the Qualtrics API that prioritize portability, 
convenience, and security. 

### Right now, with qualtr, you can:  

- keep configuration details encrypted on disk 
- render surveys as elegant pdf documents
- download response data with variable labels and appropriate factor levels
- tabulate labelled summaries suitable for further analysis, or formatted for reporting

### In future, I'm hoping to integrate: 

- contact list retrieval and management 
- support for coding likert scale batteries
- EDA oriented plotting functions

This package was inspired by Jasper Ginn's qualtRics package, and a good deal of the functionality overlaps.
